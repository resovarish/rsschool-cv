## About me
My goal is to start working in the field of front-end development.    


I have 2+ years of experience in UX design, so I understand how the product development process works and I have experience in adaptive layout.

I started studying Javascript about a year ago,   passed front-end course from EPAM Ukraine until the middle of the second stage and then I continued self-study, so now I am more confident in my abilities and hope to reach the receiving offer stage and get my first job in front-end development.


My strengths include developed soft skills (communication, teamwork, adaptability, passion for learning and analytical thinking).  I hope in the near future I will also be able to boast of developed hard skills and will make every effort for this.


I have B1 English level.
